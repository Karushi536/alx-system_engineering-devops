**Issue Summary**

**Duration:**  
Outage started at 2024-05-02 09:00 EAT and ended at 2024-05-03 05:00 EAT.

**Impact:**
The internal development server for the "QuickFinance" application experienced a severe outage. Development activities were halted, and the team was unable to push or pull code changes. Approximately 75% of our developers were affected during this period.

**Root Cause:**
A broken package installation led to a series of dependency conflicts that could not be resolved, necessitating a complete reinstallation of the server's operating system and software environment.

**Timeline**

09:00 EAT: Issue detected by a developer unable to push code changes.
09:15 EAT: Developer reported the issue to the IT support team.
09:30 EAT: Initial assumption was a network issue; network connectivity was tested.
10:00 EAT: Network confirmed to be stable; attention shifted to server diagnostics.
11:00 EAT: Server logs analyzed, revealing multiple broken packages and dependency conflicts.
12:00 EAT: Attempts made to uninstall broken packages; all efforts failed.
13:00 EAT: Escalated to senior system administrator for further troubleshooting.
15:00 EAT: Decision made to back up essential data and reinstall the server's OS.
16:00 EAT: Backup process initiated, copying critical files and configurations.
18:00 EAT: Backup completed; reinstallation of the server's operating system began.
21:00 EAT: OS installation completed; start of software and environment setup.
23:00 EAT: Reinstallation of development tools and dependencies.
02:00 EAT: Restoration of backed-up data and configurations.
04:00 EAT: Verification of system functionality and integrity checks.
05:00 EAT: Full functionality restored; development activities resumed.
**Root Cause and Resolution**

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was a broken package installation. During a routine update, a critical package was corrupted, leading to a cascade of dependency conflicts that rendered the server's software environment unstable. Attempts to remove or repair the broken packages were unsuccessful due to the extent of the corruption.

**Resolution:**
The resolution required a complete reinstallation of the server's operating system and development environment. Key steps included:

Data Backup: Essential files and configurations were backed up to ensure no critical data was lost.
OS Reinstallation: The server's operating system was reinstalled from scratch to ensure a clean and stable environment.
Software Setup: Development tools and dependencies were reinstalled, following best practices to avoid similar issues.
Data Restoration: Backed-up data and configurations were restored to bring the server back to its pre-issue state.
Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**

Implement automated backup systems to ensure data is consistently saved.
Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to isolate dependencies and reduce the risk of package conflicts.
Establish more rigorous testing for package updates before deploying them to production servers.
**Tasks to Address the Issue:**

Automate Backups: Set up automated daily backups for the development server.
Containerization: Transition development environments to Docker containers to manage dependencies more effectively.
Update Procedures: Implement a staging environment where updates can be tested thoroughly before being applied to the main server.
Monitoring: Enhance monitoring tools to detect package and dependency issues immediately.
Documentation: Update the incident response plan to include procedures for handling broken package installations.
Training: Provide training for developers and system administrators on managing and troubleshooting package dependencies.

By addressing these measures, we can mitigate the risk of similar incidents in the future and improve our overall system resilience and response capabilities.
